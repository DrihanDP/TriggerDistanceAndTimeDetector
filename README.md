# TriggerDistanceAndTimeDetector
Detects and converts the trigger distance and trigger time hex values of a CAN signal to decimal values and sorts them. This eliminates the need to load the file into Test Suite and manually look for and writing down the trigger distances and trigger times.
Currently this only works on Racelogic standard CAN signals and will only look for 100km/h - 0km/h trigger stops.
Edits will be made to make it more universal.
