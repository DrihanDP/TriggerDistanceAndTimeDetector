# TriggerDistanceAndTimeDetector
Detects and converts the trigger distance and trigger time hex values of a CAN signal to decimal values and sorts them.
Currently this only works on Racelogic standard CAN signals and will only look for 100km/h - 0km/h trigger stops.
Edits will be made to make it more universal.
